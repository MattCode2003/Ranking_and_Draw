# Ranking and Draw System
## Overview
This is a ranking and draw system designed for table tennis competitions that are
affiliated with Table Tennis England.
<br>
It will get everyone's rankings from the Alpha list that you provide and creates the groups
automatically from those rankings using the snake method taking into account any county
clashes.
<br>

## Important Info
In order to use this you must have access to the alpha list.
<br>
Once the groups have been created please move the generated files out of the folder as
they will be deleted the next time it is used.

## Future Development
In the future I am to add the following:
- menu style start screen
- Player Number Support
- Desk Chart Creation
- Support for a loosers bracket
